Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Avinash Dixit, a passionate research scholar pursuing an MSR (Master of Science by Research) from IIITB. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions that reflect my enthusiasm for Radar and AI/ML.

I have always been fascinated by Computer Vision and have worked tirelessly towards the same in the Radar domain, and I enjoy exploring its possibilities through coding and problem-solving. My goal is to create meaningful and innovative solutions that make a positive impact.
